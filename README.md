## About
This project was developed as part of the coursework for an engineering class at the University of Florida, Gainesville. 

This repository provides a framework for analyzing a turbofan jet engine's performance. The current scope of this project is to calculate the performance conditions of a turbofan engine at any stage within the engine. Different stages also are designed to communicate in order to resolve the desired parameter at the end of the engine cycle. Given an engine configuration, the package will run a performance analysis. The configuration is defined by the user as well as some of the required parameters (i.e. compressor polytropic efficiency and free stream conditions). An example engine, Engine6943.py, is provided as a template. 

Contibutions and maintanence is done by the authors listed above. Examples on how the package works can be found in the jupyter notebook Package_Demonstration.ipynb.
